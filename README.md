# Parseque

A tiny parser combinator library by Jason Brennan. Why? Because.

### Installation

Use Swift packages, or copy and paste the code in, as you like.

### Using it

The tests are probably the best place to look for examples so far. Also, the main library is decently documented in code, so please check that out too.
